# Blog Management Options

## Option 1: Markdown Files + Admin Interface

### Step 1: Create Blog Directory Structure
```
/content
  /blog
    - post-1.md
    - post-2.md
    - post-3.md
```

### Step 2: Add CMS Admin Interface
- **Forestry.io** (Now Tina CMS)
- **Netlify CMS**
- **Sanity Studio**
- **Contentful**

### Step 3: Example Blog Post Format
```markdown
---
title: "My Blog Post Title"
excerpt: "Short description..."
date: "2025-08-03"
category: "Development"
image: "/images/blog/my-post.jpg"
---

# My Blog Post Content

Your blog content here in markdown...
```

## Option 2: Simple Blog Admin (Custom)

Create a simple admin interface for adding posts:

### Features:
- Form to add new posts
- Rich text editor
- Image upload
- Category selection
- Save to JSON file

### Implementation:
- Next.js API routes
- Simple authentication
- File-based storage

## Option 3: Keep It Simple (Current)

Stay with code-based blog management:

### Benefits:
- No additional complexity
- Version controlled
- Fast and secure
- Easy to backup

### Workflow:
1. Edit Blog.tsx
2. Add new post to array
3. Commit to Git
4. Auto-deploy

## Recommendation

For your portfolio site, I recommend **starting simple** (current approach) and upgrading later if needed.

Most developer portfolios use static content since:
- Posts don't change frequently
- Content is technical (code examples work better in markdown)
- Simple deployment
- Better performance

```

### Step 2: Enable GitHub Pages

2. **Click "Settings"** tab
3. **Scroll to "Pages"** section (left sidebar)
4. **Set Source to**: "GitHub Actions"
5. **Save** the settings

### Step 3: Wait for Deployment

- Deployment typically takes 2-3 minutes

### Step 4: Visit Your Live Site

## 🔧 Repository Requirements

Make sure your GitHub repository is set up correctly:

### Repository Name
- Should be named: `Kwame` (exactly as shown)
- Must be public (GitHub Pages requires public repos for free accounts)

### Branch
- Deploy from: `main` branch
- Make sure you're pushing to the correct branch

## 🎨 Customize Before Deployment

### Essential Updates (Do These First!)
1. **Add Your Resume** 
   - Place your CV/resume file at `public/resume.pdf`
   - Or update the link in `components/Hero.tsx`

2. **Update Personal Info**
   - Edit `components/About.tsx` with your story
   - Modify `components/Portfolio.tsx` with your projects
   - Update `components/Services.tsx` with your pricing

3. **Update Contact Email**
   - Change email in `components/Contact.tsx` from `nkkwame0162@gmail.com` to your email

## 🔍 Testing Your Deployment

### Check These After Deployment:

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**404 Error on Site Load**
